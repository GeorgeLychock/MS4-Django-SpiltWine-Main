<a name="BUGS"></a>
## Bugs / Fixes
### Known Bugs
#### OPEN 
-   Size is a decimal for 750, 187, 375 etc
-   If the user does not enter search terms, the main search function returns user to the home page no matter where the user is on the site.
-   In the cart view, the subtotal does not compute correctly
-   Need to figure out what to do about product sizes since a different size also means a different price; probably going with a different size means a different SKU
-   The custom clearable file input function does not work; 

#### FIXED
-   Recipe Links on My Ratings:
    -   -   Links to recipes on My Ratings page do not work
        -   FIX: had to add "../" to the link to the link path
